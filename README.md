# Docker-basics

This repository is to cover basics of building a docker image through dockerfile.
Also this uses docker-compose.yml ( although there is no need of using that, I just wanted to show what a .yml looks like).
If you do not have docker installed on your Linux based system, you can execute bash install_docker.sh
For the beginners you can learn how basics of it work.
And for those who already know it,I would love if you can contribute to it ( with detailed explanation to target beginners)

The repository contains the following examples:
1. Simple website using node js
2. Multi stage docker build

# Simple website using node js
All you need to do is run bash start.sh and it builds the docker image using Dockerfile and runs the docker-compose.yml file.
This example just covers the basics of docker.
This just covers a basic way to host a webpage using docker.

# Multi stage docker build
In this sample project, we explore multi stage docker builds by creating a to-do list web API using ASP .NET Core 3.1
