# Docker-basics


This repositroy is to cover basics of building a docker image through dockerfile.
Also this uses docker-compose.yml ( although there is no need of using that, i just wanted to show what a .yml looks like).


All you need to do is run bash start.sh and it builds the docker image using Dockerfile and runs the docker-compose.yml file.



This example just covers the basics of docker.
Would keep on adding many things whenever i get time.
