# Docker-basics


This repository is to cover basics of building a docker image through dockerfile.
Also this uses docker-compose.yml ( although there is no need of using that, i just wanted to show what a .yml looks like).


All you need to do is run bash start.sh and it builds the docker image using Dockerfile and runs the docker-compose.yml file.



This example just covers the basics of docker.
Would keep on adding many things whenever i get time.


This just covers a basic way to host a webpage using docker.
For the beginners you can learn how basics of it work.

And for those who already know it,i would love if you can contribute to it ( with detailed explanation to target beginners)
